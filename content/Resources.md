# Resources Related to Data Science

This is a non-exhaustive list generated from suggestions by our faculty, graduate student and postdoc Affiliates and staff. Note that the DSI does not endorse any of these links specifically and is providing them here as a community-driven resource.

If there is a resource that you've found helpful that is not on this list please [tell us about it](mailto:datascience@ucdavis.edu).


# Languages

There are many programming languages used in Data Science. They all have important, but quite different, roles, and have various
advantages and disadvantages. Primary languages we use at the DSI include:

* [R](http://www.r-project.org)
* [Python](http://www.python.org)
* [Julia](http://julialang.org)
* [C](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/)

### Other languages courses and research groups use at UC Davis:

* [MatLab](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/)
* [C++](https://isocpp.org/)
* [Scala](http://docs.scala-lang.org)
* [SAS](http://www.sas.com)
* [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/index.html): Primarily used in visualization, dashboards, and mashups for webpages.
* [Fortran](http://www.nag.co.uk/sc22wg5/)
* [SQL](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer/downloads/index.html)
