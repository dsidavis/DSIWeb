# Problem Solving with Data Science

* __What__: An *un-seminar* brown bag lunch series at the DSI
* __When__:  Typically Tuesdays at noon, but schedules vary so check the [DSI calendar](http://dsi.ucdavis.edu/calendar.html) for updates.
* __Where__: [Data Science Initiative Classroom, Shields Library room 360](http://dsi.ucdavis.edu/directions.html)

**Wait, what?** 
This is a different kind of seminar. Come brainstorm about cross-University research problems in this multidisciplinary, flipped series where the audience does most of the talking to apply data science and interdisciplinary knowledge to address complex unsolved research problems. The presenter provides the question(s), and the audience leverages their combined backgrounds and expertise to suggest solutions.
 
**Who**: 
All members of the UC Davis research community (faculty, students, postdocs, staff) with a background and/or interest in data science. No experience is necessary to attend - some of the most creative solutions have come from other disciplines. Everybody can gain by participating. 
 
**Why?** 
These seminars are fun, enlightening, highly multidisciplinary, thought-provoking, and focus on cutting-edge research in progress. By watching problem solving in action you will learn a lot about data science, how to ask the right questions to get the answers you need, and how to extract information from clients and/or your own reserach program.

	*"Giving an un-seminar was eye opening, and I received great feedback. We solved one of my problems during the hour, and we started a cool conversation about my research that I found invigorating. On top of all of that, I have several new contacts for folks at UC Davis doing neat work with spatial data."* - Matt Whalen, PhD 2017

	*"The un-Seminars are one of my favorite activities at the DSI. They’re great practice and a fun puzzle solving exercise. They are also a chance to meet people outside of my field who are also into data."* - Abbie Popa, PhD
 
## Got (data) problems? *Come give a talk!*

 Stuck on a research problem you just can’t figure out? Feel like you're trying to reinvent the wheel? Have a complex research question you don't know how to tackle but think that the tools must be out there, somewhere? Want to "talk it out" with an open group of researchers and gain new perspectives on your research? Consider applying to be a speaker at our Problem Solving with Data Science un-seminar series. This un-seminar flips the traditional seminar upside down with up to 15 minutes of presentation of a research problem followed by 45 minutes of discussion. You may just leave with more answers, and more questions, to pursue! All members of the UC Davis research community (faculty, graduate students, postdocs, staff scientists) are invited to apply to give a seminar. For more information, [contact us](mailto:datascience@ucdavis.edu).

 
*Guidelines for Presenters*

This is a great opportunity to get help and feedback on applying data science to your research problems. Ideally you will come away with some suggestions to try, and new questions on aspects of your research that you hadn’t previously considered. The problem you want help with should relate to data science, but this is very broadly defined to include any aspect of the research pipeline including but not limited to:

* framing a data-driven question 
* identifying data 
* acquiring the data 
* managing the data 
* computing issues 
* cleaning the data 
* visualizing and exploring the data 
* appropriate statistical and machine learning methods 
* interpreting results and insights 
* disseminating the results and/or data
* organizing the workflow for the project

You will have no more than 15 minutes (generally 5 slides) to present your specific problem/obstacle to provide the audience with the context necessary to provide feedback. The remainder of the seminar is devoted to audience questions to clarify your problem and group brainstorming possisble solutions. 

You should:

* Provide enough background about your research question so that people from multiple disciplines can understand why it is important.
* Describe the context of the problem you are having in addressing that research problem. Identify the barriers to solving your problem.
* Detail any possible solutions you have considered and your known constraints.
* Try to identify and address possible questions the audience may raise that are not really relevant in order to keep the discussion focused on what is useful for you. 
 
To reserve a spot in the upcoming Problem Solving with Data Science series, [send us](mailto:datascience@ucdavis.edu) a title for your seminar and brief paragraph (abstract) of your problem with 2-3 photos. Please also list several specific keywords that will help grab the attention of members of the data science community and help us advertise your talk (examples: machine learning, remote sensing, GIS, visualization, sampling design, Python, etc.).
 
**A few examples of previous un-seminars:**

* Automating the extraction of data from video.
* How to use 150,000 news articles to answer questions on issue framing.
* Predictively modeling subsurface geomorphology near dam infrastructure to optimize construction.
* Uniting raster and vector data across multiple spatial scales.
