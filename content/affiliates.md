postdoc, Visiting postdoc, UCLA. <br/>
<b> Evolution and ecology of population dynamics under environmental change. </b>
Jamie is interested in how demography and evolutionary change affect traits and plastic responses of wild populations. Jamie blends theoretical modeling with computation, and develops software to confront theoretical models with heterogeneous data (e.g., trajectories of population abundance and trait values, diversity statistics calculated from genomic data). For his postdoctoral work he is developing methodology for using genomic data to inform demographic models of the desert tortoise to predict the effects development in the Mojave desert on its population viability. Jamie uses R for visualization, and python and C++ for simulations and statistical methods. Jamie is a Software Carpentry instructor. Jamie seeks to share his knowledge and learn about new tools and approaches, especially data engineering and the use of functional programming paradigms in data science.

<b> Microbial ecology of seagrass communities. </b>
Melissa has worked with terrestrial plants, ants, birds, and fungi, and now works with the plants, animals and microbes in the sea.
She is broadly interested in patterns of species diversity and how different communities of microbes have different effects on seagrass and seagrass-associated communities.
Melissa works with data describing microbial communities. She primarily uses R, but also with other languages to process and analyze sequencing data.
Melissa credits her experience at the DSI with helping her to learn cleaner and more efficient workflows. She hope to learn new skills that she can apply later when facing problems in collaborations or in her own research.
