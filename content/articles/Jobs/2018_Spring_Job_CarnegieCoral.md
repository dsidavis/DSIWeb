# Multiple Team Positions Available in Global Coral Reef Remote Sensing and Monitoring in Stanford

The Carnegie Institution’s Department of Global Ecology is pleased to announce the opening of multiple technical research and development positions in the area of ocean and coral reef remote sensing. Carnegie, in collaboration with Vulcan Inc., Planet Inc., University of Queensland, and University of Hawaii, will be undertaking groundbreaking scientific research to implement a new global coral reef monitoring system.  The system will utilize more than 100 Planet-Dove satellites currently in Earth orbit to map coral reefs and to monitor reef changes including bleaching events.  This multi-organizational team will be working within a challenging development schedule to produce the monitoring system.

Partnering organizations will play key complementary roles in the areas of satellite data provisioning, cloud computing, user interface technology, benthic classification mapping, community outreach, and stakeholder engagement.  Carnegie’s core roles will include processing of Planet Dove satellite imagery for sea surface and seafloor reflectance, ocean depth estimation, and coral reef monitoring for change including, but not limited to, bleaching events.  The Carnegie team will be led by Dr. Greg Asner.  Official announcement of the project, along with its primary funder, will be forthcoming, and will update this announcement.

We seek highly qualified individuals to contribute in a team-oriented environment to the development and implementation of the global coral reef monitoring system.  Specific skills required for these positions include:

* ocean and/or coral reef remote sensing science, or atmospheric remote sensing science, plus
* computational science including fluency in appropriate programming languages, plus
* strong scientific and technical communication skills.

Currently, we have four open positions to fill.  Two positions will focus on atmospheric and seawater correction of Planet Dove satellite image data streams, and the implementation of these processes in a massive cloud-compute environment.  Two other positions will focus on developing a high-performance methodology for detection and monitoring of coral reefs using Planet Dove satellite image data streams.  All four positions are technical, and will be highly interactive within Carnegie as well as with the multi-organization team.

These positions will be based at the Department of Global Ecology, Carnegie Institution for Science, on the campus of Stanford University in Stanford, CA.  Advanced graduate degrees (M.S. minimum, Ph.D. optimal) in ocean and/or coral reef remote sensing science, or atmospheric remote sensing, are required.  Strong quantitative and English writing skills are important, and a working knowledge of computer programming for remote sensing applications is essential.
Please submit a cover letter summarizing your interests, a description of previous research specific to this application, and a detailed CV/resume.
