[Github repo with notes, code and data]()

*The DSIâ€™s Winter 2019 workshop series focuses on Data Visualization, from principles and best practices to implementation with various technologies. Attendance at all sessions is recommended as concepts and materials build throughout the quarter. All workshops will be recorded and links will be posted here shortly after their conclusion. Learners are recommended to watch any missed workshops to best prepare for subsequent sessions.*

Building off of the concepts in the earlier workshops this quarter, DSI Director Professor Duncan Temple Lang and postdoc Jane Carlen will introduce packages for creating interactive data visualizations using JavaScript/D3 with implementations in R and/or Python. The workshop will present illustrative examples of the functionality of each package (plotly, bokeh, highcharter, crosstalk) and walk through the code used to build example interactive visualizations. The second part of the workshop will open the hood and introduce JavaScript and D3 directly.

After this workshop learners should be able to:

* Assess which tools are best for a particular application and begin using them to create new interactive visualizations

## Prerequisites & Target audience

This workshop is aimed at researchers (students, postdoctoral scholars, faculty, staff) who are working with data and using graphics for exploratory analyses and scholarly communication (i.e., publications). Learners should attend or view recordings of the prior workshops in the series.earners should be comfortable working in R and should bring a laptop with a working version of R and RStudio installed. Prior to attending, learners should pre-install the R packages: [plotly for R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plotly/index.html) , [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html), [rbokeh](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rbokeh/index.html), [crosstalk](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/crosstalk/index.html), and [highcharter](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/highcharter/index.html).
