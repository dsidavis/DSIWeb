# Probabilistic Modeling to Measure Dark Energy

Dr. Michael Schneider, Group Leader in Astronomy and Astrophysics Analytics in the Physics Divison of the Lawrence Livermore National Lab is talking about his research at the DSI on May 28, 2019 at 3-4pm.

## Abstract

Upcoming wide-field astronomical surveys such as the  Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and the NASA WFIRST mission have ambitious goals for the precise measurement of cosmological and dark energy parameters. For these surveys, the difference between a discovery of new dark energy properties and a lost opportunity is set by the mitigation of systematic errors and the propagation of the systematic residual uncertainties. Historical approaches to measurements of weak gravitational lensing of galaxy images to constrain dark energy are bounded from below in the systematic error tolerances because of mathematical limitations and non-optimal use of subsets of available data. I will describe a probabilistic or Bayesian data analysis pipeline to optimally exploit LSST and WFIRST data for constraining models of dark energy. I will describe a high-fidelity physics-based hierarchical model for galaxy populations and cosmological structure and novel approaches to Monte Carlo computations for seemingly intractable large Bayesian inference problems. Finally, I will highlight the limitations of forward modeling where our understanding of astrophysics breaks down and how we might proceed to embed the modern advances in deep learning into a principled Bayesian inference framework. 

## Biography

Dr. Michael Schneider has over 10 years of experience in applications of statistical and numerical methods to the analysis of large data sets. He wrote his Ph.D. thesis on simulation frameworks for the future Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) under the direction of the founding Director of the project. He moved to a post-doctoral position in the U.K. in 2008 working on simulations of galaxy formation on high-performance computing resources for application to the Pan-STARRS 1 sky survey. He then moved back to the U.S. in 2010 to start a science program in dark energy at LLNL targeted for the LSST.  Over the past nine years at LLNL, Dr. Schneider has built a new team at the lab in Data Analytics for astronomy. He was awarded the Department of Energy (DOE) Early Career Award in 2017 (as one of 50 scientists and engineers nationwide) for his leadership in mathematical and computational foundations for statistical inference in DOE science missions. Schneider now also leads a large inter-disciplinary research team at LLNL focused on development of novel machine learning and quantum computing algorithms. Dr. Schneider has served on a variety of U.S. government agency review teams to help plan the next generation of data exploitation approaches for upcoming synoptic sky surveys. From 2015-2018 he led the Weak Gravitational Lensing working group in the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration. At LLNL, he now serves on the Data Science Institute governing Council.
