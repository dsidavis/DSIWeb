# Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's Data Science Institute - Research and Opportunities

The newly formed Data Science Institute (DSI) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) was established to address the explosive growth of data science and its impact on LLNL’s national security mission. Michael Goldman, Director of LLNL's DSI, will present an overview of these organizations and their missions, discuss on-going internal and external activities, highlight career and internship opportunities, and discuss a few key projects and research areas where the lab is actively engaged. Later in the day, Michael Schneider (LLNL), will present a deep-dive in one of these areas, Probabilistic Modeling to Measure Dark Energy.
