Supported by the NSF scientific data reuse initiative and in-cooperation with ACM, AIDR 2019 aims to find innovative solutions to accelerate the dissemination and reuse of scientific data in the data revolution. The explosion in the volume of scientific data has made it increasingly challenging to find data scattered across various platforms. At the same time, increasing numbers of new data formats, greater data complexity, lack of consistent data standards across disciplines, metadata or links between data and publications makes it even more challenging to evaluate data quality, reproduce results, and reuse data for new discoveries.

AI researchers, scientific data community, and data management community from both academia and industry are invited attend AIDR 2019 to share solutions and ideas that address these challenges using the power of AI.  At this meeting, you will have plenty of opportunities to showcase your work, have thought-provoking conversations, and form collaborations with peer participants. A list of relevant topics can be found at the [event website](https://events.library.cmu.edu/aidr2019/)

Abstract submissions (max. 400 words) are being accepted for Long Talks, Short Talks, Posters, and Panel Discussions. Students selected to present will be entered for competitions in their respective presentation categories.  Participants will also have the opportunity to sign up for one of the “Breakout Cafes” to host or attend an informal discussion / lightning talk on a topic of their choice.
