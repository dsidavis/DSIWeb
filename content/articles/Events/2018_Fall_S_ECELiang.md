#  ECE Departmental Seminar: SGD Converges to Global Minimum in Deep Learning via Star-Convex Path


Professor Yingbin Liang from Ohio State is speaking at the Electrical and Computer Engineering departmental seminar on November 2, 2018. If you would like to meet with Professor Liang, please contact [Lifeng Lai](mailto: lflai@ucdavis.edu).

## Abstract

Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has been found to be remarkably effective in training a variety of deep neural networks. However, there is still a lack of understanding on how and why SGD can train these complex networks towards a global minimum. In this talk, I will present our recent establishment of the convergence of SGD to a global minimum in training deep neural networks. Our argument exploits the following two important properties: 1) the training loss can achieve zero value (approximately), which has been widely observed in deep learning; 2) SGD follows a star-convex path, which is verified by various experiments in our work. Following these two facts, our analysis shows that SGD, although has long been considered as a randomized algorithm, converges in an intrinsically deterministic manner to a global minimum.
