#  Data Visualization: Graphics in R

[Github repo with notes, code and data]()

*The DSIâ€™s Winter 2019 workshop series focuses on Data Visualization, from principles and best practices to implementation with various technologies. Attendance at all sessions is recommended as concepts and materials build throughout the quarter. All workshops will be recorded and links will be posted here shortly after their conclusion. Learners are recommended to watch any missed workshops to best prepare for subsequent sessions.*

Building off of the concepts in the earlier workshops this quarter, DSI postdoc Dr. Dan Hicks will focus on the computational model underlying graphics in R for creating and customizing standard and advanced static plots. This workshop will compare and describe the two primary graphics models and functions in R (traditional and ggplot) and provide an overview of the simple commands that make beautiful, complex plots and customizations for developing specialized graphics. 

After this workshop learners should be able to:

* Use traditional and ggplot syntax to create exploratory plots
* Customize plots by capitalizing on the underlying computational model, including layering, to create publication-level graphics

The last 30 minutes of this workshop are open for individual Q&A.

## Prerequisites & Target audience

This workshop is aimed at researchers (students, postdoctoral scholars, faculty, staff) who are working with data and using graphics for exploratory analyses and scholarly communication (i.e., publications). Learners should be comfortable working in R and should bring a laptop with a working version of R and RStudio installed. Learners should attend the first two workshops in the series (Data Visualization: Principles, Concepts & Best Practices) or watch the video recordings prior to attending.
