After this workshop learners should be able to:

* find the C source code for a function
* call C functions in R
* translate data structure names from R to C
* create, modify and coerce vectors in C
* understand how to use input validation

## Prerequisites & Target Learners

This workshop is aimed at researchers (students, postdoctoral scholars, faculty, staff) who are comfortable working with R and have basic C knowledge. Learners should be comfortable working in R and should bring a laptop with a working version of R installed.
