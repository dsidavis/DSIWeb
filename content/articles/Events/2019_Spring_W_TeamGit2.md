## Description

This set of 2 workshops starts by briefly reviewing the basic git commands we use every day
and then moves onto 
+ using git to share work with others in your project,
+ exploring different workflows for working by yourself and with others,
+ querying git to problem solve and understand what git is doing and why,
+ intermediate and advanced git functionality and idioms that can be very useful.

These workshops will be hands-on and each participant will work 
with another participant to practice editing and sharing changes to files. This
will give you authentic experience in confidently working with git, solving
some of the issues that arise, and knowing where to find solutions in the future.

We'll mimic real-life situations and actually solve them together with git commands.
We'll also intersperse the hands-on activities with high-level explanations of important elements of
the git computational model and how to reason about the different ways of doing things with git and their trade-offs.

## Prerequisites & Target Learners

This workshop is aimed at students, postdoctoral scholars, faculty, staff who understand how to use
Git either in principle or are somewhat familiar with its introductory-level
functionality.  Prior to attending, you should be able to add and commit files. 
Come with your laptop with git installed, and your Github account.
