#  A New Understanding of Rationality in Philosophy of Biology: How Big Data Links Mathematical Models and Empirical Data with Environmental Politics

Professor Emily Grosholz from Pennsylvania State University is talking at the DSI on May 14, 2019 at 3pm.

## Abstract

Mathematics has always seemed like the heart of theoretical rationality, whether as Plato suggested, it informs metaphysics, or as early Egyptian and Greek astronomers knew, it organizes cosmological models and astronomical data. During the past decade, after studying mathematical models in Early Modern physics (noting how physics leads mathematicians from the study of algebraic curves to the study of transcendental curves) and in twentieth century chemistry (noting how group theory combined with the notation and theory of matrices in representation theory transforms the study of molecules), I've been looking at the use of mathematics in biology. I always argue against philosophical reductionism (the organism can be computed from its DNA!), and so have learned from the writings of Richard Lewontin, and have paid close attention to the study of whole organisms, plants and animals, in current biological research. But this has led to a renewed sense of the central important of mathematics. I have studied  the statistical models (Aster Models) developed by Ruth Geyer Shaw and Charles Shaw to study populations of plants on mid-western prairies, and the work of Ted Grosholz and his group collecting 'big data' on populations on the Pacific coast subject to invasive species. Both communities of researchers ponder the best ways of organizing and computing the complex data they collect, and also how to bring it into relation with political / ethics issues of climate change, pollution and biodiversity, which means presenting it to the public as well the scientific community.
 
## Bio
 
Emily Grosholz has been working on the philosophy of mathematics, and extending that study to the interaction of mathematics with the sciences, since she earned her BA in Ideas and Methods at the University of Chicago in 1972, and a PhD in Philosophy at Yale University in 1978. She has been teaching in the Philosophy Department at the Pennsylvania State University for forty years, and interacting with colleagues in mathematics, physics, cosmology, biology and chemistry. She is a member of SPHERE at the University of Paris Denis Diderot / Paris 7. After two books on Descartes and Leibniz, her book Representation and Productive Ambiguity in Mathematics and the Sciences was published by OUP in 2007, and Starry Reckoning: Reference and Analysis in Mathematics and Cosmology was published by Springer in 2016, and won the Fernando Gil International Prize for Philosophy of Science in 2017. Her sabbatical project is entitled "New Trends in Philosophy of Biology: Mathematical Models, Ethics and Politics."
