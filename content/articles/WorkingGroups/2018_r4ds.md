# R for Data Science Meet and Work Session

## About

The R for Data Science reading group is a pre-dinner appetizer offering snacks, data science, and camaraderie. This reading group meets weekly to support those reading and working through exercise in *[R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz)*, by Hadley Wickham and Garett Grolemund. All are welcome to join.  Contact DSI graduate student Affiliate [Rich Pauloo](mailto:rpauloo@ucdavis.edu) for more details.

## How it Works

* Each week, every member reads a chapter (any chapter) of *R for Data Science* before coming to the group.  
* We begin each session by sharing snacks. This is critical and cannot be skipped.  
* We then each share a 1 minute insight from out reading. Can be a function, thought, etc.  
* We spend the rest of the hour working independently or in small groups, either reading or doing exercises from the book.
