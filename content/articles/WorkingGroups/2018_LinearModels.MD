A reading group on statistical modeling. During winter quarter 2018, we will meet every other Wednesday from 3-5 PM. Tentatively each meeting will be focused on a particular topic related to statistical modeling. The first hour will be loosely dedicated to theory/readings and the second hour will be focused on application/tutorials. Participants from all fields and level of expertise are welcome. Please join #dsi-models on the UC Davis slack if interested.
