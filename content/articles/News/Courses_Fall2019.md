# Fall 2019 Courses

## MAT 280: Harmonic Analysis on Graphs and Networks

Instructor: [Naoki Saito](mailto:saito@math.ucdavis.edu) 
CRN: 48880
Schedule: Tuesdays & Thursdays 1:40pm-3:00pm
Location: 2112 Math. Sci. Bldg.
First class: Sep. 26 (Thu), 1:40pm @ 2112 MSB

Synopsis: Graphs and networks have been successfully used in a variety of fields (e.g., machine learning, data mining, image analysis, sensor networks, social sciences, etc.) that are confronted with the analysis and modeling of high-dimensional datasets. Harmonic analysis tools originally developed for Euclidean spaces and regular lattices are now being transferred to the general settings of graphs and networks in order to analyze geometric and topological structures, and data and signals measured on them. In this course, we shall discuss a variety of important theories and interesting applications employing harmonic analysis of and on graphs and networks.
Topics include: graph Laplacians, their eigenvalues and eigenvectors for structural/morphological analysis; spectral clustering; wavelets on graphs; random walks and diffusion on graphs; optimal transport theory and applications on graphs, etc.

Prerequisite: MAT 129, MAT 167, MAT 271, or consent of instructor.
Course material: Will be provided by instructor. For reference, the older version of the course website is: https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~saito/courses/HarmGraph/
Grading scheme: Class attendance + final project report.

## STS 298: Data Feminism Working Group

Conveners: [Emily Merchant](mailto:ekmerchant@ucdavis.edu), [Lindsay Poirier](mailto:lnpoirier@ucdavis.edu), [Pamela Reynolds](mailto:plreynolds@ucdavis.edu)
CRN: Registration for credit is available (email conveners), but not required for participation.
Schedule: Bi-weekly October 2019 through March 2020 (days/times TBD)
Location: Data Science Initiative and Feminist Research Institute
First meeting: TBA

Synopsis: Making decisions based on the evidence, free of individual bias, is often a stated goal of data science. But, computers and code are part of sociotechnical systems that embody the biases of our society and data, and reflect existing structures of inequality. Increasingly, data science also has the potential to reveal the sources of inequality and inform social justice projects. In this working group sponsored by the Feminist Research Institute, we propose to explore the interaction between systems of power and oppression within the development and application of the data sciences. Over the course of ten meetings in Fall 2019 and Spring 2020 students will work at the intersection of feminist theory, critical data studies, and data science to explore four themes surrounding data feminism: feminist critiques of data science, causes and consequences of the lack of diversity in data sciencei, how mis-applications of data science perpetuate social inequality, and critical and participatory data science.
