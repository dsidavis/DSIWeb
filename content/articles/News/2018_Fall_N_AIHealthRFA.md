# Call for Applications: Reserach at the Intersection of AI and Healthcare

The UC Davis Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Healthcare Working Group is requesting applications for
innovative approaches for the use of AI in healthcare. Our goal is to establish cross-campus
collaborations for the generation, enhancement, and use of AI, automation, and robotics for the
betterment of human and animal health. The purpose of this call is to identify and support meritorious
AI projects administratively, technically, and financially in the form of seed grants of up to $20,000.
The most important criteria for selection of a project is a transformative, paradigm-shifting idea and
the potential impact of this idea on healthcare. This is NOT a call for support of ongoing projects or
projects that will linearly increase the knowledgebase. *Cross-department, school, and causeway
collaborations are highly encouraged*. It is expected that these collaborations will be multidisciplinary
and members of the team will be added in the application for funding process and execution of the
project. External collaborations are permissible but not required.

## Eligibility

All academic senate and federation members in good standing at UCD.
Application: The deadline for receipt of this application is Thursday, November 15, 2018 at 5PM.
The application may be directed, but is not limited to, enhancing the delivery of healthcare (e.g.
underserved populations and persons with disabilities), improving communications (e.g. enhancing
Epic), developing new centers of AI expertise (e.g. collaborations with industry), using large data sets
in novel ways, and/or basic or applied research (e.g. integrating “omics” data in human and animal
diseases).

The initial application is a 2-page statement of the vision of this application to include the aims,
innovation, approach, synergistic collaborations, feasibility, and impact of the project. No preliminary
data is required. If the application is highly rated, then the applicant will be asked to present his/her
idea to the working group.

Projects may request funds for PI, co-PI, and co-I investigator salaries, infrastructure (servers, core
facilities use, etc.), personnel (grad student assistants or short-term staff, course buyouts or summer
salary for faculty, etc.), or travel/entertainment for facilitating meetings and/or bringing in external
expertise. Funding is for 1 year, with an option of a second year of funding if sufficient progress is
made.

## Apply

Applicants should submit an electronic version of the application to [Mary Mumper](mailto:mamumper@ucdavis).edu by 5 PM on *November 15, 2018*.

## Review

Each submitted proposal will be assigned to 3 members of the working group with relevant expertise for review. The proposal will be rated on innovation, potential impact, synergistic collaborations at UCD, and approach including feasibility.
