[Dan Hicks](djhicks@ucdavis.edu) is a postdoc at the DSI conducing research in data-driven academic
institutional effectiveness. He received his PhD in philosophy from Notre Dame
and MS in Mathematics from the University of Illinois, Chicago. Prior to coming
to the DSI he was a AAAS Science & Technology Policy Fellow at the EPA and NSF,
and a postdoc at the University of Western Ontario.

During office hours, Dan can provide feedback on:

* Bibliometrics: Scopus, CrossRef web interface and API
* Beginner through intermediate skills in R: ggplot for plotting, igraph for network analysis, dplyr for SQL-like data wrangling, RStudio
* Philosophical issues in statistics and Data Science (How do you decide between frequentist or Bayesian methods? What should you do about P-hacking and alpha cutoffs? How do you know you've picked the right test? etc.)

DSI staff are available for office hours in the DSI Classroom to
help with your data science problems. Drop-ins are welcome, but *we
recommended that you email the individual you want to meet with in advance* in
case of any schedule changes.
