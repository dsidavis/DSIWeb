# Education & Training

The DSI offers workshops (short seminars, half to full day, or multiple day modules) that complement the material taught in regular courses, provide hands-on applications, and present new topics and under development techniques. Workshop topics depend on the needs of our data science community and available expertise. 

*All members of the UC Davis community (students, postdocs, faculty, staff) are welcome to register.* [DSI Affiliates](membership.html) have priority registration.

Workshops are announced here and on our listserv. [Subscribe](signup.html) for notices about future workshops.

All workshops are in the [DSI Classroom, room 360 in Shields Library](http://dsi.ucdavis.edu/directions.html). Workshops are generally on Fridays from 9:30am - noon unless otherwise noted.
